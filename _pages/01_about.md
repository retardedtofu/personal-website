### Hi! My name's Elwin.

### I'm a design strategist based in Toronto.

<br>
<br>

I’ve done branding, graphic, product, app, and web design/dev (and academic research before that) but I’m more emotionally invested in applying all these skills into solving big problems for different clients, of which design thinking happens to be the best tool to solve them with.

I graduated from college to synthesize grey-goo, but realised the cross pollination of different technical thinking methods needed in nanotech could be easily transferred to design. Hence here I am :-)

## awards

> ### Outstanding Student, HK PolyU Master of Design 2015 --- 2016
